# Cassette Calculator
I was tired of having to look up the total length of an album when dubbing cassettes, then splitting it properly. It was a bit of a hassle.

I've made this calculator to determine how many tracks to include on each side of a cassette, or a possible way to reorder tracks so that they're divided more evenly.
